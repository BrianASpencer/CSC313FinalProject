In most cases the source is the spell itself. For example Lightning Bolt says “Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target.” Such a spell is affected by Fire Servant’s ability.

You choose that target as you activate the ability not at the time it prevents damage.£8/15/2010 : If the targeted player is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves the entire ability doesn’t resolve. No damage will be prevented.£8/15/2010 : Vengeful Archon’s ability doesn’t have you choose a source of damage. It will apply to the next X damage you would be dealt that turn regardless of where that damage comes from. It doesn’t matter whether the damage would all be dealt at the same time. For example if X is 4 and you’d be dealt 3 damage by Lightning Bolt that 3 damage is prevented and Vengeful Archon deals 3 damage to the targeted player. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 1 damage you’d be dealt that turn.£8/15/2010 : The effect of Vengeful Archon’s ability is not a redirection effect. If it prevents damage Vengeful Archon (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the targeted player as part of that prevention effect. Vengeful Archon is the source of the new damage so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don’t affect this damage. The new damage is not combat damage even if the prevented damage was.£8/15/2010 : Whether the targeted player is still a legal target is no longer checked after Vengeful Archon’s ability resolves. For example if a player targeted by Vengeful Archon’s ability puts Leyline of Sanctity (which says “You can’t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control”) onto the battlefield after the ability resolves but before it prevents damage the ability will still prevent damage and still deal damage to that player. If Vengeful Archon can’t deal damage to the targeted player (because the player is no longer in the game in a multiplayer game for example) it will still prevent damage. It just won’t deal any damage itself.£8/15/2010 : If Vengeful Archon’s ability doesn’t prevent any damage (perhaps because a different prevention effect is applied to the damage that would be dealt to you or because the damage is unpreventable) Vengeful Archon won’t deal any damage itself.£8/15/2010 : If Vengeful Archon’s ability prevents damage Vengeful Archon deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are checked and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If a spell or ability would have caused that damage to be dealt this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.£8/15/2010 : If you would be dealt combat damage by multiple attacking creatures you choose which of that damage to prevent. For example if X is 3 and you’d be dealt combat damage by a 1/3 Scroll Thief and a 3/5 Siege Mastodon you might choose to prevent 1 damage from the Scroll Thief and 2 damage from the Siege Mastodon. You don’t decide until the point at which the creatures would deal their damage.£8/15/2010 : If the amount of damage that would be dealt to you is in excess of the amount of damage that Vengeful Archon’s ability would prevent that source deals its excess damage to you at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then Vengeful Archon deals its damage.£8/15/2010 : If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt the player who would be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example say you’ve activated Vengeful Archon’s ability with X = 3 targeting Player A and you’ve activated Vengeful Archon’s ability with X = 1 targeting Player B. You’re dealt 2 damage. You can apply the first prevention effect (dealing 2 damage to Player A) or you can apply the second prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player B) followed by the first prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player A).

This includes creatures that come under that player’s control after the ability has resolved and creatures that have lost all abilities.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s first ability causes creatures to attack him if able. If during the affected player’s declare attackers step a creature they control is tapped is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t attack or is affected by “summoning sickness” then that creature doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having a creature attack the player isn’t forced to pay that cost so the creature doesn’t have to attack in that case either.£6/15/2010 : If a creature controlled by the affected player can’t attack Gideon Jura (because he’s no longer on the battlefield for example) that player may have it attack you another one of your planeswalkers or nothing at all.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s first ability applies during each combat phase of the affected player’s next turn (as opposed to applying during the affected player’s next combat phase).

Note that summoning sickness cares about when Gideon Jura came under your control not when he became a creature.£6/15/2010 : Gideon Jura’s third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type) and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).£6/15/2010 : If you activate Gideon Jura’s third ability and then unpreventable damage is dealt to him (due to Unstable Footing for example) that damage has all applicable results: specifically the damage is marked on Gideon Jura (since he’s a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he’s a planeswalker). If the total amount of damage marked on Gideon Jura is lethal damage he’s destroyed as a state-based action. If Gideon Jura has no loyalty counters on him he’s put into his owner’s graveyard as a state-based action.£6/15/2010 : Say you activate Gideon Jura’s third ability then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon Jura (since he’s still a planeswalker). Then Gideon Jura may block (since he’s a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature including one that’s attacking him! During combat he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature as appropriate. For example he deals combat damage to any creatures he’s blocking but he doesn’t deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.£1/22/2011 : The first ability only affects the declaration of attackers. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking (thanks to Hero of Bladehold Preeminent Captain or the Ninjutsu ability for example) that creature’s controller may choose the defending player or planeswalker that it will be attacking in the normal way.','','+2: During target opponents next turn creatures that player controls attack Gideon Jura if able.£−2: Destroy target tapped creature.£0: Until end of turn Gideon Jura becomes a 6/6 Human Soldier creature thats still a planeswalker.
