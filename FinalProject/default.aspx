    <h3>What is MTG Core?</h3>
    <p>
        MTG Core is a website dedicated to providing information about the MTG Core Sets. The MTG Core Sets are Wizards of the Coast's,
        the creators of Magic: The Gathering, way of introducing new players to the game. The Core Sets employ simpler card mechanics, such as single color
        only cards, a lack of complex game mechanics, etc. Beginners will have an interface to interact with Magic: The Gathering in a much
        simpler fashion, so that getting in to the game isn't such a barrier.
